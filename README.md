This is a simple to-do webapp built upon the django framework.

I created this webapp from [here](https://medium.com/fbdevclagos/how-to-build-a-todo-app-with-django-17afdc4a8f8c). It provides the entire code, the configuration.

Run this on your system Using the following commands:

`./manage.py runserver 9200`

Then navigate to `localhost:9200/` on a browser of your choice.

Use the WebApp
